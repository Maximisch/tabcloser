# TabCloser

## What is TabCloser?
Tabcloser is an extension for Chromium browsers that periodically checks for commonly redirected tabs for <b>Figma</b> files, joining <b>Zoom</b> meetings, opening <b>Spotify</b> links, <b>VS Code Live Share</b> invitations, and <b>Discord</b> invites to automatically close them.

## TabCloser Options

By default, Figma, Zoom, Spotify, VS Code Live Share, and Discord invites are enabled. Just deselect any service that you don't want tabs to close for automatically. You can also change the interval that TabCloser is checking your tabs to close them, by default it's `30 seconds`.

Let's breakdown how TabCloser decides if it should close a tab. TabCloser is using regular expressions to look for a partial match on a dedicated URL for each service.

Here's how TabCloser is handling regular expressions:

`^`: The start of the URL

`https?://`: This will match "http://" or "https://"

`([a-z0-9-]+\\.)?`: This isn't included in each service, but it's to detect a subdomain, followed by a dot "."

`example\\.com/`: This matches the primary URL of a particular service


#### Figma
For Figma, tabloser is using `^https?://figma\\.com/file/'`

The `figma.com/file` designates it is a file URL, not a Community profile, template, plugin, ..etc. File URLs can be redirected to the Figma desktop client.

#### Zoom
For Zoom, TabCloser is using `^https?://([a-z0-9-]+\\.)?zoom\\.us/j/[^/]+#success$`

The `([a-z0-9-]+\\.)?` and looking for `zoom\\.us/j/` as a designated join link, and then looking for `+#success` when a Zoom link is successfully redirected to the Zoom desktop client.

#### Spotify
For Spotify, TabCloser is using `^https?://open\\.spotify\\.com` 

The `open\\.` portion is typically associated with opening a song, artist, playlist, ..etc which can be opened in the Spotify desktop client.

#### VS Code Live Share
For Live Share, TabCloser is using `^https?://vscode\\.dev/liveshare`. 

The `/liveshare/` is associated with the Live Share URL which can be opened in the VS Code desktop client.

#### Discord
For Discord, TabCloser is using `^https?://discord\\.com/invite/`. 

The `/invite/` is associated with a Discord invite which can be opened in the Discord desktop client.

## Requested Permissions
TabCloser requests a few permissions in the `manifest.json` file.

`chrome.tabs` allows TabCloser to interact with Figma, Join Zoom, Spotify, VS Code Live Share, and Discord Invite tabs and close them.

`chrome.storage` allows TabCloser to save your `enabled` or `disabled` auto close preferences for a particular service and saves the interval you've set for checking tabs from the options menu.
